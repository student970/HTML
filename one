      <h5>Feelings about Gon and Killua</h5>
      <p>Seeing Gon and Killua's interactions were fun. They did a lot of things that we out of the box, like using a fishing rod for a weapon or manipulating their appearance.</p>

      <h5>Feelings about Kurapika</h5>
      <p>His arc is so stupid. He can protect so many people with his power but he is so selfish. He pretend to be righteous but he acts like a little child who throws a fit when he doesn't get his way. </p>
